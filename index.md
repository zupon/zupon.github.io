I am a linguist.


Currently, I am a Computational Linguist at Google, working on NLG for the Google Assistant. You can learn more about my general interests (academic and non-academic) on my [About Me](aboutme.md) page, or you can take a look at some of the specific projects I've been working on on my [Projects](projects.md) page.
